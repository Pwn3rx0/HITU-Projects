By combining authentic historical content with modern artificial intelligence technologies, the application seeks to bridge the gap between the past and the present in an engaging and accessible way.\n\nAt the core of the app lies a deep respect for Egypt's ancient civilizations. It provides users with concise, informative overviews of Egypt's ancient kingdoms, along with guides to major archaeological sites and regional tourist attractions. These resources are designed not only to educate but also to promote cultural tourism and appreciation of Egypt's rich legacy.\n\nOne of the app's standout features is \"Chat Anubis\", a multilingual chatbot that supports 59 languages and 117 dialects. This ensures that users from all over the world can interact with the app in their native language, making the experience inclusive and user-friendly.\n\nIn addition, the app employs Computer Vision technology to recognize pharaoh statues and other artifacts. Upon recognition, it provides users with detailed historical context, enhancing the interactive experience and making learning about history feel intuitive and personal.\n\nUltimately, this application represents a fusion of heritage and innovation. It brings the story of ancient Egypt to life through a seamless blend of culture, technology, and design—making the wonders of the past relevant and accessible to today's global audience.",

The system leverages advanced artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to provide an autonomous, efficient, and secure access solution. The core functionality involves real-time video streaming from an ESP32-CAM to a host server running a Flask web application. This server performs sophisticated face detection using YOLOv8-nano and identity recognition through DeepFace (utilizing Facenet512/ArcFace embeddings). Upon successful authentication of an authorized individual, the system wirelessly transmits control signals to an ESP8266 microcontroller, which actuates a physical access mechanism.\nA key strength of this system is its robustness and resilience. It incorporates advanced error handling, including exponential backoff and automated reconnection strategies for camera streams, ensuring continuous operation even under network instability. The web interface offers intuitive user management, real-time visual feedback with dynamic overlays, and comprehensive access logging, enhancing administrative oversight. Empirical results demonstrate high frame rates (e.g., 10 FPS for local webcam, 40  FPS for ESP32-CAM) and a low false acceptance rate, validating its effectiveness. This project provides a cost-effective, open-source, and highly adaptable solution for smart access control, showcasing the seamless integration of AI, web technologies, and IoT.",

      "description": "This project presents the design and implementation of a Real-time Face Recognition and Access Control System, aimed at revolutionizing conventional security paradigms. The system leverages advanced artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to provide an autonomous, efficient, and secure access solution. The core functionality involves real-time video streaming from an ESP32-CAM to a host server running a Flask web application. This server performs sophisticated face detection using YOLOv8-nano and identity recognition through DeepFace (utilizing Facenet512/ArcFace embeddings). Upon successful authentication of an authorized individual, the system wirelessly transmits control signals to an ESP8266 microcontroller, which actuates a physical access mechanism.\nA key strength of this system is its robustness and resilience. It incorporates advanced error handling, including exponential backoff and automated reconnection strategies for camera streams, ensuring continuous operation even under network instability. The web interface offers intuitive user management, real-time visual feedback with dynamic overlays, and comprehensive access logging, enhancing administrative oversight. Empirical results demonstrate high frame rates (e.g., 10 FPS for local webcam, 40  FPS for ESP32-CAM) and a low false acceptance rate, validating its effectiveness. This project provides a cost-effective, open-source, and highly adaptable solution for smart access control, showcasing the seamless integration of AI, web technologies, and IoT.",

A Flask-based backend handles the translation and delivers output to a responsive web interface supporting both Arabic and English languages, including text-to-speech functionality. Communication between the glove and the web interface is achieved over Wi-Fi via an ESP32 microcontroller, assuming both are connected to the same local network.

It supports multilingual workflows (Arabic, English, and more) and offers comprehensive handling of personal details, medical records, specialist notes, laboratory results, radiology images, and longitudinal health data. Patients log in to secure personal dashboards to review their complete records, while authorised staff manage doctors, nurses, emergency physicians, ICU teams, lab and radiology technicians, and administrative users through role‑based access controls.\n\nA flagship capability is the Smart Emergency Request: one press of the SOS button on a patient’s dashboard transmits a real‑time alert—with live geolocation—to the hospital’s emergency desk. Staff immediately see the patient’s full profile and can dispatch an appropriate medical team to the reported location.\n\nKey features include:\n• Multilingual user interface\n• End‑to‑end patient, doctor, and staff management\n• Live‑location emergency alerts\n• Digital patient profiles (reports, labs, imaging)\n• Role‑based permissions (admin, doctor, nurse, etc.)\n• Modern 3‑D‑style user experience\n• Scalable architecture suitable for hospitals, clinics, and health centres",
